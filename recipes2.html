                Ingredients for the cupcake: </br>
            
            
            
                3/4 cup plain flour</br>
1/4 cup cocoa powder</br>
1/2 cup caster sugar</br>
2 tsp baking powder</br>
1/2 tsp vanilla essence</br>
80 g butter</br>
1/2 cup milk</br>
2 eggs</br>
            
            Directions:</br>
        
Preheat oven to 160C. </br>
Prepare 12 hole muffin tray </br>
Sift all dry ingredients into a mixing bowl.</br>
Make a small well in the middle of the bowl and then add remaining ingredients.</br>
Beat on low speed with electric mixer until just combined.</br>
Scrape down sides of bowl and beat on medium speed for a further two minutes.</br>
Place tablespoons of the mixture into 12 hole muffin tray until holes are half full. Heaped teaspoon of mixture for mini muffins.</br>
Place tray into oven for 15-18 minutes for 12 hole muffin pan or 10-12 minutes for mini muffin pan.</br>
Stand for 5 minutes and then turn out onto wire rack to cool.</br>
Make a basic white icing and place on top of the cupcakes for the snow effect.</br>

Ingredients for the tree: </br>

Ice-cream cones </br>
Icing sugar </br>
Vanilla essence </br>
Milk </br>
Green food colouring </br>

To decorate the tree: </br>

Sprinkles (round, stars, etc), Food gel </br>

Directions: </br>

Place the icing sugar in a bowl.
Add 1 tablespoon of milk and the vanilla essence.
Mix thoroughly.
Add more milk one teaspoonful at a time until the desired consistency is reached (you need it maleable enough to wrap it around the cones).
Put in the green food colouring and stretch the dough over a clean smooth surface. Take a sheet of this dough and wrap it around a cone until it is all covered. Cut the excess dough. You can use a mixture of water and sugar to use as a "glue" to stick the icing around the cone.
This mixture can also help to keep the cone over the cupcake. 
Place the cone over the iced cupcake. Use the sprinkles and food gel to decorate the tree.</p>
